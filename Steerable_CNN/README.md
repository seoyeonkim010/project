# Steerable CNN vs Vanilla CNN

## This project is a comparative analysis between two different CNNs to see which nerual network captures the rotational symmetry of dataset.

## Dataset: MNIST-M

## Model: cnn.pth, scnn.pth (unzip this after download)

## Accuracies: cnn-accuracies.npy, scnn-accuracies.npy

## project.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook to learn Steerable CNN

## Libraries: escnn (https://github.com/QUVA-Lab/escnn)

## Dataset Images: test_dataset.png, rotated_test_dataset.png
